    <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the experiment, you are going to be reading each sentence as a series of word "chunks". To do this, the experiment will only show one part of the sentence at a time. When a sentence first appears, it will look like a series of dashes, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
    ___ _____ ____ __________
    </p>
    <p>
    To read the sentence, you will press the <b>spacebar</b>. Pressing the spacebar will cause the current word to disappear, and will reveal the next word of the sentence. So when you press the spacebar for the first time, the display changes to look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>The</u> 
    </p>
    And when you press it again, that first word disappears to reveal the next word of the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>silver</u>
    </p>
    Continue hitting the spacebar all the way through to the end of the sentence, revealing sentence word by word so that you are reading at normal pace for you. Please do not stop when you are in the middle of a sentence. Try to avoid going too slow, but don't go too fast either! <b>Note: Please read each sentence silently to yourself. Do not read out loud!</b>
