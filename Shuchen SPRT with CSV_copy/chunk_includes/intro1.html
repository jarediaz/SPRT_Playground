<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
This experiment requires your <b>full attention</b> and must be completed in one session. <b>It is important to read the words carefully</b> - move through the sentences as fast as you can while still understanding the sentence. You will receive feedback if your response is incorrect. It is common to make occasional mistakes, but participant data that show persistent lack of attention may be rejected.</p>

<p>There will be 30-second breaks after a set number of sentences. After 30 seconds, the sentences will resume automatically. If you step away from the experiment, the sentences will continue to advance without a response and you will not be able to properly complete the study.
</p>
<p>
In this experiment you will read words from English sentences, one word at a time, and choose the <b>best of two words to continue the sentence</b>. During the trials, you should rest your hands on the keyboard with a finger on the <b>e</b> and <b>i</b> keys. You will use these keys to register your choice, when presented with a screen like the following:</p>

All of the sentences will be questions. There will be several practice trials to get used to the experiment design before the main experiment begins.
